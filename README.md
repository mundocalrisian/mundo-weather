### React Data Fetching

This web application was completed as part of my Software Development Bootcamp with Northcoders.

The task was to create a React-based interface that presents data from a third party API in an interactive and engaging way.

I chose to use [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/api) and [Geoapify](https://www.geoapify.com/) to show the current weather and forecast for a specific location
